    <div class="info">

      <h2>  This game is based on the concept of famous electronic game of memory skill, The Simon.</h2>

      <p class="flt">
         The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.
         If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex.
         Once the user fails, the game is over.</p>

      <p>
         We have recreated The Simon as its virtual version.</p>
         <p>
           This is how to play.
           </p>
        <p>
           Press a key on keyboard when on Computer or tap the Start button on Mobile Devices.
         Now any random square will glow. Press the square the glowed and the next square will glow.
         Now is the tricky part, we don't have to press the next square immediately. First we press the first square and then the second square that glowed.
         And if the sequence in which you pressed the squares was correct then next button will glow up and you still have to follow the same, i.e.,
         first press the first then second then third glown square. This continues till you press a wrong button. As soon as the level increses, it becomes harder to remember the pattern.
         My personal highest is also till level 14 only till date😂.
