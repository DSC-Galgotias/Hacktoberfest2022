Encrypt and Decrypt Messages using Python.

I created a GUI application to encrypt and decrypt using Python.

It will first ask you if you want to encrypt a message or decrypt it. Then the program should receive a message from the user.
If the user chooses to encrypt the message, the user’s message must be transformed into a secret code. But if the user chooses to decrypt the message, your program should be able to convert a secret code into a meaningful text.
